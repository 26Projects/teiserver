Currently SPADS executes changes to the battle lobby based on commands from players; Teiserver facilities the commands and as such can perform a Man in the middle atttack. This could be utilised to enable Teiserver to have its own set of commands that take effect when Teiserver Bossmode is enabled.

Enable with: `!teiboss` and disabled with `!spadsboss`

##### Commands functions desired:
- Draft mode - two captains taking it in turns to pick players for their team
-  Player lock - New members of the battle can only spectate, preventing team size and composition from juggling
-  Player saved presets
-   Multiple choice voting - E.g. suggest multiple maps, eveybody votes for one
