- Bracket designs
- Tourney types (bracket, round robin etc)
- Ability to connect one tourney to another (e.g. TI group stages -> main event)
- Signup process, might need to be linked to discord
- Track bat
- Admin functionality, maybe something like they temporarily have "friends list" like interactions with all players?
- Challonge API https://api.challonge.com/v1
- Don't allow spectators in tourney games except mods/organisers (as an option)

### Ideas - Extra
- Predicitons
- Ability for people to sign up as standins should people drop out
- Ability to jump to spectate a player's game
- Automatically pull people into their game if ready
- Alerts of when a game should be starting and warnings to admins regarding late starts
