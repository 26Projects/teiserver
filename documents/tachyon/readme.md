## Tachyon
Tachyon is a protocol designed for a client-server architecture for computer games; it is able to facilitate player messaging/chatting, game rooms, matchmaking and other such things. It is not designed for in-game netcode, just everything surrounding your netcode. These documents are written with developers in mind, players and general users should never even need to know the name of the protocol, let alone how it works.
