# Teiserver
An Elixir implementation of Uberserver

## Sorry for the mess
I'm in the process of adding a webserver component to it and I've quite literally copied and pasted code from my own site. This is because I'm running it on the site and integration is easier this way. Additionally my site already has things like user authentication so it is significantly faster to just copy it over!

## Documentation
- [Setup instructions](documents/setup.md)
- [Architecture](documents/architecture.md)
- [Testing](documents/testing.md)

### Rough roadmap (very happy to change it up):
- Remaining Spring commands
- Permissions system
- More units tests
- End to end tests
- Locked/passworded chat rooms
- Periodically clean up empty chat rooms
- Logging certain actions (in particular mod actions)
- Spam/Flooding controls
- Email on user registration/password reset

### Post parity todo
- Have random numbers generated by a single thread to prevent new threads using the same start seed and always having the same sequence
- Matchmaking
